Project Name: BrainCell
Authors: Marcelo Maza and Maxwell Zetina

The purpose of this website was to propose a solution for students and professors to more easily keep track of assignments and to facilitate in-class learning. The Live Class learning feature allows for students to type questions during lecture and staff to answer them. Furthermore, the students are able to see the lecture notes real-time on their devices and screenshot the current slide or page and download it for faster note-taking.
